# jmws_drupal_idMyGadget_bartik-d8

Code to integrate idMyGadget [jmws_idMyGadget_for_drupal-d8](https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_idMyGadget_for_drupal-d8) with the default Drupal 8 theme Bartik.

Note that there is an experimental version of this repo named [jmws_drupal_idMyGadget_bartik-d8-exp](https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_drupal_idMyGadget_bartik-d8-exp).

Also, there are previous efforts!  At this time, this is the most recent one (and hopefully the last).

* First try was with Drupal 7; there was an incompatibility issue with jQuery Mobile and the version of jQuery that it was using

* Second try was with Drupal 8; it changed a lot and did not get very far

* Third try was also with Drupal 8, it was pretty much "stillborn" in that I did not get very far at all, because we had an issue with jmws_drupal_stark_idMyGadget-d8 (for more information, see that "second try" repo)

This repo incorporates changes made to the previous repos as appropriate, but at this time we are creating it mainly to have its name consistent with jmws_drupal_idMyGadget_stark-d8 , which magically does not have the mysterious and very serious issues (unable to add blocks, wtf?!?) we had with jmws_drupal_stark_idMyGadget-d8.
